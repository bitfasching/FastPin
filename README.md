# [MOVED] FastPin Library for Arduino

**Note: FastPin has been renamed to [FastDigitalPin](https://github.com/bitfasching/FastDigitalPin) to avoid conflicts with FastLED.** Unfortunately, the popular library for driving RGB LEDs includes a FastPin class on its own which pollutes the global namespace. I decided to rename my FastPin to be able to coexist with FastLED. This repository only exists as legacy to keep links in old projects working. For documentation, please refer to the new repository.**
